### Hi there 👋

If you wanna know the roots of _Agile_, read

* Introduction to the Smalltalk-80 System; Adele Goldberg; [Byte Magazine Volume 06 Number 08 - Smalltalk](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08)
* Personal Dynamic Media; Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg; [IEEE Computer, Volume 10, Issue 3, March 1977](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1646405)

It means you can do pair programming with your user. If you can't do that, you have the wrong tools.

Another root of _Agile_ is _Lean_, which means making work visible to improve it.

I am currently building two applications:

* [makehuman.js](https://github.com/markandre13/makehuman.js) a variant of [Makehuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) with some features missing and some (being) added, like motion capturing.
* [workflow](https://github.com/markandre13/workflow) a 2d vector graphics program

and the tools to build them with

* [toad.js](https://github.com/markandre13/toad.js) build WebApp GUIs leveraging the [Presentation Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) and [Humble Object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumbleObject.html) pattern, Web Components, Typescript and TSX.
* [corba.js](https://github.com/markandre13/corba.js) / [corba.cc](https://github.com/markandre13/corba.cc) seamlessly connect WebApp GUIs with what does not fit into the browser.
* [async.cc](https://github.com/markandre13/async.cc) an ECMA script style C++ coroutine class for corba.cc
* [kaffeeklatsch](https://github.com/markandre13/kaffeeklatsch) an C++ unit test framework similar to RSpec / Mocha & Chai

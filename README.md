### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently building two applications:

* [makehuman.js](https://github.com/markandre13/makehuman.js) a variant of [Makehuman 1.2.0](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) with some features missing and some (being) added, like motion capturing.

  I also did a WebApp of [Makehuman 0.9.1-rc1a](https://github.com/markandre13/mh091rc1a.js) which used morphs for posing, including muscles.
  
* [workflow](https://github.com/markandre13/workflow) a 2d vector graphics program

and the tools to build them with

* [toad.js](https://github.com/markandre13/toad.js) WebApp GUI toolkit leveraging the [Presentation Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) and [Humble Object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/HumbleObject.html) pattern, Web Components, Typescript and TSX.
* [corba.js](https://github.com/markandre13/corba.js) / [corba.cc](https://github.com/markandre13/corba.cc) seamlessly connect WebApp GUIs with what does not fit into the browser.
* [async.cc](https://github.com/markandre13/async.cc) an ECMA script style C++ coroutine class for corba.cc
* [kaffeeklatsch](https://github.com/markandre13/kaffeeklatsch) an C++ unit test framework similar to RSpec / Mocha & Chai

If you wanna contact me, my mail is on the left.

Cheers,
Mark
